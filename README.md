## What I Learnt

Building a BitTorrent client with Node.js was a fascinating dive into how peer-to-peer file sharing works under the hood. I got to explore concepts like torrent metadata, peer communication, and how pieces of a file are downloaded and reassembled. It was a mix of networking, binary data handling, and some trial and error, but super rewarding!
